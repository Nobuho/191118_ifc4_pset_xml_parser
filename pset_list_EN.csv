TN type system, a system having one or more points of the source of energy directly earthed, the exposed conductive parts of the installation being connected to that point by protective conductors, 
TN C type system, a TN type system in which neutral and protective functions are combined in a single conductor throughout the system, 
TN S type system, a TN type system having separate neutral and protective conductors throughout the system, 
TN C S type system, a TN type system in which neutral and protective functions are combined in a single conductor in part of the system,

Ballasts are needed to operate Discharge Lamps such as Fluorescent, Compact Fluorescent, High-pressure Mercury, Metal Halide and High-pressure Sodium Lamps. 
Magnetic ballasts are chokes which limit the current passing through a lamp connected in series on the principle of self-induction. The resultant current and power are decisive for the efficient operation of the lamp. A specially designed ballast is required for every type of lamp to comply with lamp rating in terms of Luminous Flux, Color Appearance and service life. The two types of magnetic ballasts for fluorescent lamps are KVG Conventional   (EC-A series) and VVG Low-loss ballasts (EC-B series).

Electronic ballasts are used to run fluorescent lamps at high frequencies (approx. 35 - 40 kHz)."

Pset_WindowCommon	Smoke Stop	Indication whether the object is designed to provide a smoke stop (TRUE) or not (FALSE).
Pset_WindowCommon	Fire Exit	Indication whether this object is designed to serve as an exit in the case of fire (TRUE) or not (FALSE). Here it defines an exit window in accordance to the national building code.
Pset_WorkControlCommon	Work Start Time	The default time of day a task is scheduled to start. For presentation purposes, if the start time of a task matches the WorkStartTime, then applications may choose to display the date only. Conversely when entering dates without specifying time, applications may automatically append the WorkStartTime.
Pset_WorkControlCommon	Work Finish Time	The default time of day a task is scheduled to finish. For presentation purposes, if the finish time of a task matches the WorkFinishTime, then applications may choose to display the date only. Conversely when entering dates without specifying time, applications may automatically append the WorkFinishTime.
Pset_WorkControlCommon	Work Day Duration	The elapsed time within a worktime-based day. For presentation purposes, applications may choose to display IfcTask durations in work days where IfcTaskTime.DurationType=WORKTIME. This value must be less than or equal to 24 hours (an elapsed day); if omitted then 8 hours is assumed.
Pset_WorkControlCommon	Work Week Duration	The elapsed time within a worktime-based week. For presentation purposes, applications may choose to display IfcTask durations in work weeks where IfcTaskTime.DurationType=WORKTIME. This value must be less than or equal to 168 hours (an elapsed week); if omitted then 40 hours is assumed.
Pset_WorkControlCommon	Work Month Duration	The elapsed time within a worktime-based month. For presentation purposes, applications may choose to display IfcTask durations in work months where IfcTaskTime.DurationType=WORKTIME. This value must be less than or equal to 744 hours (an elapsed month of 31 days); if omitted then 160 hours is assumed.
Pset_ZoneCommon	Reference	Reference ID for this specified type in this project (e.g. type 'A-1'). Used to store the non-classification driven internal project type.
Pset_ZoneCommon	Is External	Indication whether the element is designed for use in the exterior (TRUE) or not (FALSE). If (TRUE) it is an external zone at the outside of the building.
Pset_ZoneCommon	Gross Planned Area	Total planned gross area for the zone. Used for programming the zone.
Pset_ZoneCommon	Net Planned Area	Total planned net area for the zone. Used for programming the zone.
Pset_ZoneCommon	Publicly Accessible	Indication whether this space (in case of e.g., a toilet) is designed to serve as a publicly accessible space, e.g., for a public toilet (TRUE) or not (FALSE).
Pset_ZoneCommon	Handicap Accessible	Indication whether this space (in case of e.g., a toilet) is designed to serve as an accessible space for handicapped people, e.g., for a public toilet (TRUE) or not (FALSE). This information is often used to declare the need for access for the disabled and for special design requirements of this space.
